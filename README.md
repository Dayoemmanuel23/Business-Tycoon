Business Tycoon Simulator üè¢üíº
A Python-based object-oriented programming (OOP) demonstration that models different types of business tycoons with realistic attributes, behaviors, and economic interactions.

Overview
This project implements a class hierarchy representing various types of business magnates, demonstrating key OOP principles including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each tycoon has unique capabilities based on their industry specialization.

Class Structure
Base Class: BusinessTycoon
The foundational class representing a generic business magnate with core attributes and methods:

Attributes: Name, industry, net worth, companies owned

Key Methods:

display_profile(): Shows public profile information

make_business_deal(): Simulates business transactions with success/failure outcomes

_acquire_company(): Protected method for company acquisitions

get_net_worth()/set_net_worth(): Encapsulated access to financial data

Specialized Subclasses
TechTycoon - Technology Industry Specialist
Special Attributes: Technology specialty, patents portfolio

Unique Methods:

file_patent(): Intellectual property management

innovate(): Special ability to generate value through innovation

RealEstateTycoon - Property Development Specialist
Special Attributes: Real estate portfolio

Unique Methods:

purchase_property(): Property acquisition functionality

market_boom(): Benefits from real estate market fluctuations

OOP Principles Demonstrated
Encapsulation üîí
Private attributes using double underscores (__net_worth)

Protected attributes using single underscores (_companies_owned)

Getter/setter methods for controlled attribute access

Read-only properties for sensitive data

Inheritance üìä
Specialized tycoon classes inherit from the base BusinessTycoon class

Each subclass extends functionality with industry-specific attributes and methods

Polymorphism üé≠
Method overriding: Each subclass implements its own version of display_profile()

Unique behaviors: Specialized methods for each tycoon type

Installation and Usage
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed

Clone or download the script

Run the program:

bash
python business_tycoon.py
Example Output
The simulation demonstrates:

Initial tycoon profiles with net worth and business holdings

Industry-specific activities (innovation, property acquisition)

Business deals with randomized outcomes

Financial changes reflected in net worth calculations
